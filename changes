core:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
plugins.py:

Plugins have trouble defining an area where they can place files 
(like admin_msg.py) so I completely changed how the plugin loading system works. 
Each plugin is called via a loader which does the importing like the original 
but it also, if a flag is raised, creates a directory in the plugin folder with 
the same name as the plugin. A function is then available for to get the paths 
to these directories. Import aliasing is still supported. 

I've changed any hard path's in the plugins to point to one of these 
directories.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
config.py:

Vanilla minecraft keeps only one world directory. Bukkit uses multiple so a 
single variable won't work. Instead changed WORLD_DIR to a WORLD_DIRS = [] were 
you can link to each world. In vanilla this would just be:
         
WORLD_DIRS = [os.path.join(SERVER_DIR, 'world')] 
        
In bukkit it becomes 
        
WORLD_DIRS = [os.path.join(SERVER_DIR, 'world'), 
              os.path.join(SERVER_DIR, 'world_nether'), 
              os.path.join(SERVER_DIR, 'world_the_end')]

This will also allow for extensions into additional worlds that are added onto 
the server.

Other changes:

- Reformatted the config file.

- added in a variable LOG_DIR where I'm sending all logs.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
helpers.py:

 - Changed how the all_users command works with respect to the changes in 
   config. Although this is only for neatness. Bukkit doesn't actually store 
   player info in anything but the 'world' world. 


- Changed how ops worked as it would hang if the ops.txt file was empty.

- Changed server_cmd to work on my server.

===============================================================================
plugins: (I didn't include any of the zones files as you seem to be messing with
          them still)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
adminmsg.py:

- Got it working again. Alerts ops when they log in if the message file is not 
  empty.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
bad_cmd.py:

- Removed the ban/pardon restrictions as they don't apply any more.

- Not implementing as I'm using mods on the server so I have external commands.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
log_all.py:

- Changed a hard link section to:
	f = open(path.join(LOG_DIR, "all_packets.log"), 'a')
  and added some imports for that to work.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
log_sorted.py:

- Changed a directory link to:
	DIR = os.path.join(LOG_DIR, "packets")
    if not os.path.exists(path):
        os.makedirs(path)
  so it should stop throwing exceptions when it can't find the directory.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
menu_test.py:

- The tests work fine but removing as test code.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
persistent_store.py:

- Was getting errors as the JSON files did not exist. Made it so that if they
  don't exist a empty dict is used instead.
- Also changed localisation to its own folder in plugins.
- several changes so just diff the two versions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
slimeballs.py:

- made this work again.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
welcome.py:

- Edited for blocksoc.

===============================================================================
Questions:

-As you are still messing with them I didn't implement or alter the zone files. 
 That said, will be there be problems if I add additional worlds/dimensions to 
 the server?
